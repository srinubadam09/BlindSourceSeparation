## **Blind Source Separation (BSS) using NMF and ICA in MATLAB**  

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of **Blind Source Separation (BSS)** techniques, specifically using **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** and **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**. The code processes mixed audio signals to extract independent sources, which is useful in applications such as speech enhancement, noise reduction, and biomedical signal processing.  

### **Features**  
âœ… Reads and processes audio signals  
âœ… Implements **SNR-based noise addition**  
âœ… Performs **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** for spectral analysis  
âœ… Applies **NMF-based source separation**  
âœ… Computes **Mean Square Error (MSE) for evaluation**  
âœ… Visualizes results with spectrograms  

### **Requirements**  
- MATLAB  
- Audio files: `sp11(1).wav` (speech) and `train.wav` (noise)  

### **Usage**  
1. Place the required audio files in the same directory.  
2. Run the MATLAB script to mix, process, and separate signals.  
3. Visualize the separated signals using spectrogram plots.  

### **Applications**  
ðŸ”¹ Speech enhancement  
ðŸ”¹ Biomedical signal processing (e.g., EEG denoising)  
ðŸ”¹ Audio source separation in music
